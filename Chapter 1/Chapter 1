1. Which of the following are operators, and which are values? *, 'hello', -88.8, -, /, +, 5,

4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?

5. This chapter introduced assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?

6. What does the variable bacon contain after the following code runs?
  bacon = 20
  bacon + 1
  -bacon is going to contain 20, bacon + 1 computes 21, but since it doesn't assign the new value to bacon, then we still retain the value 20 of bacon. 
   A better expression would have been - 'bacon = bacon + 1' or bacon += 1

7. What should the following two expressions evaluate to? 'spam' + 'spamspam', 'spam' * 3
